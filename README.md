This program creates a mosaic by assembling several images to create one big picture.

# Dependencies
- PIL or wand for images manipulation
- optionally colormath for a better color distance calculation

# TODO
- check that the number of images and the given constraints match
- add Wand support (http://dahlia.kr/wand/), and benchmark it compared to PIL
- add tests
- add the ability to set min usage and max usage settings on individual images
- delete unused reduced size images when originals are no longer here
